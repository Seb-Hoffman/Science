            A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer.
            <br><br>
            Considered by some to be "father of the computer", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's Analytical Engine.<br><br> His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as "pre-eminent" among the many polymaths of his century.
            In 1822, Charles Babbage began with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of polynomial functions. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of finite differences, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.

                    The design of a complex machine called the Difference Engine which could be used for computation of    
                    Polynomial functions.  The Difference Enginer was not completed because of cost diagreements.                 
                    Charles Babbage was English and began work on the difference Engine in 1822 and was never completed. However it was finally constructed between 1989 and 1991 to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Babbage's Birth.

                    Babbage also designed the Analytical Engine, which could be used for general computation.
                    The machine used punch cards and the programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day assembly languages.
                    The work on the design of the Analytical Engine started in 1833.  By 1840 Babbage had developed some two dozen programs for the 
                    Analytical Engine.

                    In 1838, Babbage invented the pilot (also called a cow-catcher), the metal frame attached to the front of locomotives that clears the tracks of obstacles; he also constructed a dynamometer car. His eldest son, Benjamin Herschel Babbage, worked as an engineer for Brunel on the railways before emigrating to Australia in the 1850s.
